# Forking this repository to create a personalized page for a school
Doorstop Education

1. Fork the repo.
2. Add the github to netlify and add it as a subdomain to all custom domains.
3. Upload a logo to /assets/images/ and name it doors.svg, optionally adding a white version named doors-white.svg.
4. For all "form" Doorstops, add the specific contact point for your school.
5. Go to /onboarding to configure all necessary changes.
6. Link to a specific google sheet, maybe?
7. Change the landing page to some other content, or make the main landing page the student-facing one currently at /student.
8. Remove Doorstops from the feed you're not interested in showing students.
9. Sync changes from the main fork often, as that is where new Doorstops will be added!
