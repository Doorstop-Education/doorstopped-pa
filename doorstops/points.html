 <!--But first, storytime.<br>There was this reform movement called standards-based grading. Everybody got a 1, 2, or 3 on every assignment. No A’s and B’s. There were infinite retakes and no late penalties. This spread nationwide and… FLOPPED. Hard.<br>Grade-free courses only work in high trust environments where people will do the work either way. Create part of this trust and you can remove some of the most toxic grading practices.-->
